| European (Re)Insurers | HNR1 GY | Well 2014 for us was quite a good year, I would say. As you can see, we managed to increase the after-tax earnings of the group by more than 10%, and as this has been driven by strong underlying earnings from all segments, so that we could continue with our rather conservative policy when it comes to the reserves, be it on the P&C side or be it on the Life & Health side. | Ulrich Wallin | CEO | 2014/01/01|
